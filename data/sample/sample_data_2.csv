"Automating the practice of science: Opportunities, challenges, and implications","Automation transformed various aspects of our human civilization, revolutionizing industries and streamlining processes. In the domain of scientific inquiry, automated approaches emerged as powerful tools, holding promise for accelerating discovery, enhancing reproducibility, and overcoming the traditional impediments to scientific progress. This article evaluates the scope of automation within scientific practice and assesses recent approaches. Furthermore, it discusses different perspectives to the following questions: where do the greatest opportunities lie for automation in scientific practice?; What are the current bottlenecks of automating scientific practice?; and What are significant ethical and practical consequences of automating scientific practice? By discussing the motivations behind automated science, analyzing the hurdles encountered, and examining its implications, this article invites researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to navigate the rapidly evolving frontier of automated scientific practice."
Random Forests for Heteroscedastic Data,"Random forests are a popular machine learning technique that are effective across a range of scientific problems. We extend the standard algorithm to incorporate the uncertainty information that arises in heteroscedastic data - datasets where the amount of noise in the target value varies between datapoints. We consider datasets where the relative amount of measurement noise in different datapoints is known. This is not the standard scenario, but does commonly exist in real data, as we illustrate on 10 drug design datasets. Utilising this uncertainty information can lead to significantly better predictive performance. We introduce three random forest variations to learn from heteroscedastic data: parametric bootstrapping, weighted random forests and variable output smearing. All three can improve model performance, demonstrating the adaptability of random forests to heteroscedastic data and thus expanding their applicability. Additionally, variations in the relative performance of the three methods across datasets provides insight into the mechanisms of random forests and the purpose of the different random elements within the model."
